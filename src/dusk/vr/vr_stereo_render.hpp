// Stereo per-eye render loop for the Dusklight VR mod.
// All Aurora and game API calls are now real — no TODO stubs.
//
// Key sources read to write this:
//   extern/aurora/include/aurora/gfx.hpp  - aurora::gfx::create_pass,
//                                           resolve_pass, push_custom_draw
//   include/f_op/f_op_view.h              - view_class fields (projMtx,
//                                           viewMtx, lookat, fovy, aspect …)
//   src/dusk/frame_interpolation.cpp      - how Dusklight already drives
//                                           C_MTXPerspective + mDoMtx_lookAt
//                                           per-frame; we slot in before that
//
// --- Integration overview ---
//
//   The per-frame camera path in frame_interpolation.cpp already does:
//       C_MTXPerspective(view->projMtx, view->fovy, view->aspect,
//                        view->near_, view->far_);
//       mDoMtx_lookAt(view->viewMtx, …);
//       j3dSys.setViewMtx(view->viewMtx);
//
//   For VR, we call that same block TWICE, once per eye, each time
//   replacing view->lookat / view->fovy / view->aspect with the HMD eye
//   pose and asymmetric FOV from xrLocateViews, then calling
//   aurora::gfx::create_pass / resolve_pass around the scene draw.
//
//   The outer frame loop (in m_Do_main.cpp) calls aurora_begin_frame()
//   then runs the game's render pass then aurora_end_frame(). We need to
//   wrap that middle section with a VR stereo loop. The cleanest hook is
//   right before the interpolation block sets the view matrices, so we
//   drive both eyes from the same already-interpolated world state.
//
// --- Getting resolved frames into OpenXR swapchains ---
//
//   resolve_pass() returns aurora::gfx::ResolvedTargets which contains
//   wgpu::TextureView (WebGPU, via Dawn). OpenXR's D3D12 swapchain gives
//   us XrSwapchainImageD3D12KHR which wraps an ID3D12Resource.
//   To bridge them, use Dawn's native D3D12 backend interop header:
//       #include <dawn/native/D3D12Backend.h>
//   Call dawn::native::d3d12::Texture::GetD3D12Resource() on the texture
//   that backs the view, then CopyResource into the XR swapchain image.
//   That code lives in vr_xr_submit.hpp (not yet written) and is
//   deliberately kept separate since it depends on the swapchain session
//   being open; the render/camera logic here does not.

// arbitrary point (wherever the headset was when the XR session started,
// see vr_xr_bootstrap.hpp's poseInReferenceSpace = identity), in metres,
// with zero relationship to where Link/the game camera actually is. During
// normal gameplay this could coincidentally look plausible if a level's

// current camera eye position for this frame, correct whether that's normal
// follow-cam or an authored cutscene camera). Orientation still comes

// Head-locked HUD billboard
//
// The flat 2D HUD (hearts, rupees, message boxes -- see m_Do_graphic.cpp's
// mDoGph_drawHud2D()) used to be drawn per-eye with a raw screen-space
// orthographic projection, identical in both eye textures -- zero stereo
// disparity, which reads as either "painted on the lens" or an otherwise
// uncomfortable, badly-defined depth. Instead, mDoGph_gInf_c::
// captureHudBillboard() (m_Do_graphic.cpp) renders that same flat HUD once
// per frame, before either eye's pass opens, into a small shared texture --
// getHudBillboardTexObj() -- and this draws that texture as a real 3D quad
// using the eye's actual asymmetric projection, so it gets correct per-eye
// convergence like a real object sitting a fixed distance away instead of a
// flat image glued to each eye's raster grid.
//
// The panel derives its alpha from the captured COLOR itself (a "luma key")
// rather than the captured texture's own per-pixel alpha channel:
// individual HUD element materials don't reliably produce a usable alpha
// value (confirmed in-headset -- real per-pixel alpha blending made the
// whole panel invisible even though the captured color content was
// verified correct via a forced-opaque debug pass; same class of "this
// material's translucency isn't simple texture alpha" finding as
// CLAUDE.md's water-reflection investigation, which was never fully
// root-caused there either; and unlike the eye-buffer readback path,
// aurora's GXCopyTex destination pointer here is only a GPU-texture-cache
// key, not real CPU-readable pixel data, so directly inspecting captured
// alpha values from code isn't an option either). The capture's clear
// color is black, so summing R+G+B (see drawHudBillboard()) gives ~0 alpha
// for empty background and higher alpha for any real HUD content --
// not pixel-perfect (a near-black icon pixel would read as transparent
// too) but avoids an open-ended per-material investigation.

// lagging your rotation is what actually reads as "steadier", not laggy).

// VR menu billboard (Dusklight/RmlUi menu, made visible in the headset)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Goal (explicit user request, 2026-08-16, Phase 2 of the VR-menu feature --
// Phase 1, controller open/navigate, is already confirmed working, see
// vr_menu_gamepad.hpp): the Dusklight menu previously only rendered to the
// desktop window's own surface -- opening it in VR did nothing visible in
// the headset. Full research trail + verified facts in the approved plan,
// C:\Users\joeyw\.claude\plans\fizzy-finding-minsky.md, and the vr-mod-notes
// skill's "Phase 2" section -- summary here, not re-derived:
//
// RmlUi already renders into a real, separate, copyable wgpu::Texture
// (extern/aurora/lib/rmlui.cpp's s_renderTarget, exposed read-only via the
// new aurora::rmlui::get_render_target()) -- NOT tied to the desktop
// window's swapchain view. Critically, the only thing that writes into it
// (record_frame()) is only ever called from aurora::end_frame(), which --
// per m_Do_main.cpp's real call order -- always runs AFTER dusk::vr::tick()
// has already finished that same frame's own per-eye rendering. So
// s_renderTarget is always a fully-finished PREVIOUS frame throughout the
// whole VR eye loop -- no torn reads, no double-buffering needed, just one
// frame (~11-14ms) of inherent latency, imperceptible for a UI overlay.
// Deliberately NOT attempting to make record_frame() run earlier -- it
// calls g_context->Update() (advances RmlUi's animation/input timers), so
// calling it twice a frame would double-advance UI state.
//
// The bridge (GX texture object <- raw WebGPU texture): a GXTexObj doesn't
// own a texture itself, its `data` field is just an opaque cache-key
// pointer -- aurora::gx::ensure_external_copy_texture() (new, mirrors
// GXCopyTex's own GXState::copyTextureCache/copyTextures[dest] population,
// see gx.cpp) lets us populate that same cache from content that ISN'T the
// output of a real GX render, so the texture object below resolves to a
// texture we can freely CopyTextureToTexture into ourselves.
//
// RmlUi's alpha is real and PREMULTIPLIED (confirmed via aurora.cpp's own
// compositing pipeline, g_CopyPremultipliedAlphaPipeline) -- unlike HUD's
// alpha (never meaningfully authored, hence HUD's luma-key TEV workaround
// above), so this billboard samples GX_CA_TEXA directly and uses
// GX_BL_ONE/GX_BL_INVSRCALPHA, NOT HUD's GX_BL_SRCALPHA/GX_BL_INVSRCALPHA.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Tunable placement/size -- untested starting guesses, to be tuned live
// in-headset like every other tuned distance in this project. Deliberately
// NOT reusing HUD's constants: HUD is a glanced-at status overlay

// was the key evidence: the SAME menu document, viewed on the flatscreen
// desktop window and in the headset AT THE SAME TIME, looked dark/opaque
// on the monitor but bright/transparent in VR. Both consumers were
// directly re-verified by reading the actual code (not assumed): the
// flatscreen path (aurora.cpp's end_frame(), g_CopyPremultipliedAlphaPipeline)
// and this billboard's own draw (GX_BL_ONE/GX_BL_INVSRCALPHA) both
// correctly implement premultiplied-alpha "src-over" compositing, and both
// read the exact same aurora::rmlui::get_render_target() texture -- no
// obvious formula or format mismatch found despite a real look. Rather
// than keep chasing exactly where the two paths' actual alpha values
// diverge in practice (would need real GPU-side pixel readback
// instrumentation to pin down further, not yet built), this sidesteps the
// question entirely: draw a solid quad at the exact same position/size as
// the real menu content, immediately BEFORE drawMenuBillboard() so normal

// of the panel. VR's panel background is now dark/solid BY CONSTRUCTION,
// not by depending on alpha data matching between two independently-

// screen, a completely separate document from every other RmlUi window --
