// being false. Callers should call tick() first, then check this to decide
// whether fpcM_DrawIterater/cAPIGph_Painter should ALSO run this frame:

// that open their OWN GXCreateFrameBuffer pass (e.g. the minimap/map-screen,

// isRenderingToHeadset(), to tell "unsafe to nest a second offscreen pass
// right now" apart from "VR is active this frame but no eye pass is open

// floats up high and you jump to her (FLG0_UNK_100/checkMidnaLockJumpPoint()
// branch). Both of those set the base game's own broader
// FLG0_WOLF_NO_POS flag ("her position isn't being driven by riding on

// (vr_link_visibility.hpp) -- see that function's own comment for the
// full reasoning. Added 2026-08-19, same-day follow-up to
// isVrFirstPerson() above: while Third Person is on, hookshot aim/fly/
// hang forces isVrFirstPerson() true so the CAMERA stays head-anchored
// (avoiding the third-person "subject" aim camera's underground-drift
// bug) -- but per explicit user request the hookshot MODEL itself should
// NOT also track the real controller during that same window; it should
// keep following Link's normal animated hand pose instead. Call site:
// daAlink_c::applyTrackedHookshotGripTransforms() (d_a_alink_hook.inc) --
// use this instead of getLeftItemMatrix()/getRightItemMatrix() directly
// when deciding whether to read the tracked-hand-relative matrix or the
// raw body-joint matrix.

// Runs the first half of one VR frame: xrWaitFrame/xrBeginFrame, per-eye
// render (including the fpcM_DrawIterater/cAPIGph_Painter draw call), and
// encodes (but does not yet submit) the eye-texture copy for each eye.
// Caller must NOT also call fpcM_DrawIterater/cAPIGph_Painter for this
// frame when calling tick() -- tick() does that once per eye internally.
// Caller's normal per-frame input read (mDoCPd_c::read(), etc.),
// fapGm_Execute(), and mDoAud_Execute() should still run exactly once per
// frame as usual; only the final draw call is replaced by tick().
//
// CHANGED this session: tick() no longer does the swapchain submit or
// xrEndFrame itself -- see submitFrame() below for why and where that
// moved. Every tick() call (that renders real eyes; see isActive()/
// isRenderingToHeadset() above) must be followed by a submitFrame() call
// later the same frame, after the caller's own aurora_end_frame().
//
// FIXED this session: takes the caller's already-computed FrameTiming
// instead of calling dusk::game_clock::advance() a second time. That
// function mutates shared clock state on every call (unconditionally stamps
// s_previous_sample = now, among other things) -- calling it again here
// corrupted the frame-pacing bookkeeping for every VR frame, since the
// second call always saw a near-zero elapsed time versus the first call
// m_Do_main.cpp already made a few instructions earlier. Pass the same
// timing through instead of re-deriving (and re-mutating) it.
void tick(const dusk::game_clock::FrameTiming& pacing);

// Call once per frame, right after the caller's own aurora_end_frame() --
// NOT inside the aurora_begin_frame()/aurora_end_frame() pair tick() runs
// in. Finishes what tick() started: reads back each eye's copied pixels,
// uploads them into the XR swapchain image, releases the swapchain image,
// and calls xrEndFrame(). Required because tick() returns before
// aurora_end_frame() actually submits the frame's GPU work, so the copy
// tick() encodes isn't safe to read back until after that Submit() has
// run. Safe to call unconditionally every frame -- a no-op if tick()
// didn't actually render stereo eyes this frame.
