// swing) or a different triggerSpeed; retune with real
// [dusk::vr::swingdiag]-style data if the user reports it's off, same

//
// TUNED 2026-08-05, ROUND 2 (real [dusk::vr::swingdiag] capture analyzed --
// see git history/vr-mod-notes for the full log breakdown, not repeated
// here). Round 1 (triggerSpeed=1.4/resetSpeed=0.4/minSwingDistance=0.08,
// user feedback "technically worked but very unresponsive" on the
// untouched 2.5/0.8/0.15 defaults) turned out to be tuned TOO far down:
// the captured log showed one frame of ordinary "hold the controller
// neutrally and turn around" movement hitting 1.44 m/s -- just over
// round 1's 1.4 m/s trigger -- firing a spurious attack (confirms the
// "swings when I move normally" report). The dt source itself (predDt vs.
// pacing.dt, logged side by side specifically to
// check this) tracked each other almost exactly throughout that phase, so
// this was a plain threshold problem, not a timing/jitter bug. The SAME
// capture's real-swing phase logged 13 separate triggers (speeds ~1.5 up
// to ~17 m/s) against only ~5 visible in-game sword swings -- likely
// Link's own attack-animation lock absorbing extra virtual B-presses
// (same as mashing the real button), not under-detection, so round 2 only
// raises thresholds (to comfortably clear the observed 1.44 m/s false-
// positive peak with real margin) rather than trying to make it MORE
// sensitive. resetSpeed/cooldownSec also nudged up to reduce the chance of
// one continuous swing motion dipping-and-re-arming into a double count.
// Tuned here rather than in the shared header so g_rightThrust (or any
// future user of SwingDetector) isn't silently affected by tuning specific
// to this one gesture.
//
// ROUND 4 (2026-08-13) -- user report "missed swings (real swings don't
// register)" after round 3 (see history above). A fresh
// [dusk::vr::swingdiag] capture (227 samples) showed this WASN'T a
// triggerSpeed problem -- the vast majority of samples with speed well
// above 2.2 m/s (many in the 3-7+ m/s range, dozens of them) simply never
// triggered. Cross-checked against SwingDetector::update()'s actual logic
// (vr_swing_detector.hpp): canFire_ only resets once speed drops to AT OR
// BELOW resetSpeed -- a hard one-shot re-arm gate, not a decaying window.
// During a real multi-swing test, hand speed only briefly dips (if at all)
// between individual swings, so round 3's resetSpeed=0.7 m/s left the
// detector "stuck" not-armed through most of a continuous flurry --
// directly confirmed in the capture (e.g. one stretch: a real trigger at
// speed 2.48 m/s, then SIX consecutive high-speed samples up to 6.4 m/s
// all logged TRIGGERED=0, before it finally re-armed ~650ms later). This
// is the opposite failure mode from round 2's original "one continuous
// swing double-counts" concern that motivated raising resetSpeed in the
// first place -- but cooldownSec (a hard TIME lockout, unchanged at 0.15s)
// already covers that same concern independently, so lowering resetSpeed
// back down doesn't require also touching cooldownSec. triggerSpeed/
// minSwingDistance are untouched -- no evidence in this capture that
// either is currently a problem (neutral-movement speeds stayed
// comfortably under ~1.1 m/s against the 2.2 m/s trigger).

// begin_frame() firing multiple times in rapid succession mid-scene-draw
// (see [dusk::frameinterp::beginframe] in the diagnostic added to that
// function), with a step=0.0 argument landing right in the middle of an
// otherwise-healthy frame -- and tick() unconditionally resets
// g_duskVREyePassOpen = false at its own top on EVERY call. An exhaustive
// codebase-wide search found dusk::frame_interp::begin_frame() has only
// ONE real caller (m_Do_main.cpp's three call sites, all part of one
// straight-line sequence immediately before dusk::vr::tick() is invoked)
// -- there is no code path that legitimately calls it again mid-tick().
// The only way to reproduce the observed pattern is if tick() itself is
// being called RE-ENTRANTLY -- a nested call starting while an outer
// tick() call is still mid-draw, most likely triggered by a nested
// Windows message pump somewhere deep in the scene draw (the corruption
// correlated tightly with water's GXCopyTex/resolve_pass substitution in
// the captures that showed it, though that specific trigger is not
// independently confirmed) -- clobbering the outer call's in-progress
// state (g_duskVREyePassOpen, and indirectly g_step via the nested call's
// own begin_frame-adjacent work) out from under it.
//
// Fix: guard tick() against re-entrancy directly, rather than continuing
// to hunt for the exact nested-pump trigger -- this closes the symptom
// regardless of what causes the nested call, and any real fix for the
// nested-pump cause itself (if one is ever found) can layer on top
// without conflicting with this guard. RAII rather than a plain flag +
// manual reset at every return point: tick() has many early-return paths
// (no session, XR call failures, shouldRender==false, view not ready,
// etc.) and a plain flag would need updating at every single one --
// easy to miss one and leave the guard permanently "stuck" true.
